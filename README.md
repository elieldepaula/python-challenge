# Python Challenge Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of my Python development skills. Includes a JSON-RPC API, which performs some actions for Docker management.

The project was developed in Python 2.7, using Flask on the back end, and a [very] simple front end, developed with Bootstrap and Jquery, just to trigger actions on the back end. Front end is not my specialty.

You will be able to create, start and stop your docker containers directly from the browser.
